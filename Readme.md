## Installation

* Quit Atom
* Go to `Atom.app`
* *Get Info* on `Atom.app`
* Drag `atom.icns` onto it's icon at the top left of the info window.
* Enjoy!

The following might also help:

* Go to `Atom.app`
* Right click > *Show Package Contents*
* Navigate to `Contents/Resources`
* Remove `atom.icns`. You can either delete it or move it (hold Command while dragging)
* Copy `atom.icns` from this folder into `Resources`

You can also drag `file.icns` into the Resources folder although I haven't been able to get this to work.
